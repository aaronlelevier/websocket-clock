# Websocket example

This repo is a combination of the example code used in *Programming Erlang 2nd Ed.* by Joe Armstrong chapter 18 "Browsing with Websockets in the Browser". Repo link::

[https://github.com/joearms/ezwebframe](https://github.com/joearms/ezwebframe)

And the websocket starter template in the Erlang Cowboy repo link:

[https://github.com/ninenines/cowboy/tree/master/examples/websocket](https://github.com/ninenines/cowboy/tree/master/examples/websocket)

I took both sources as a reference and adapted to work, since I was having trouble running the [ezwebframe](https://github.com/joearms/ezwebframe) example as-is on the most recent Erlang Cowboy version
